# philosophers

Eat, Sleep, Spaghetti, repeat. This project is about learning how threads work by precisely timing a group of philosophers on when to pick up forks and eat spaghetti without dying from hunger.

-> The philo folder contain the mandatory part of this project where we have to deal with threads and how to avoid them to datarace thank to mutexes and atomic variables.
-> The philo_bonus folder is the same project exept we swap threads with processes and mutexes with semaphores to pass the project.
